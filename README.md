## TASK DESCRIPTION

The internship project focuses on developing a complete data pipeline that automates the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using widely adopted tools in the data science ecosystem. The core objective of 
this task is to design and implement a pipeline that efficiently handles data preprocessing, transformation, and loading operations using Pandas and Scikit-learn libraries in Python. This hands-on project will
equip interns with the practical skills necessary to manage and process real-world data in a structured and reproducible way.

The first component of the task is data preprocessing, where the intern will create functions to read raw input data, typically from a CSV file or similar format. This stage includes identifying and handling
missing values, correcting data types, removing duplicates, dealing with outliers, and performing basic data exploration. Preprocessing ensures that the data is clean, consistent, and reliable before further 
transformation is applied. Using Pandas, the intern will implement methods for inspecting data, identifying common issues, and applying fixes through filtering, imputation, and conversion.

The next stage is data transformation, which focuses on preparing the preprocessed data for analysis or model development. This includes converting categorical variables into numerical formats using techniques
such as One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding, and scaling or normalizing numerical features using Scikit-learn’s preprocessing utilities. Additional transformations may include feature generation or
dimensionality reduction, depending on the complexity of the dataset. The intern will modularize these transformation steps to ensure they can be reused or modified with minimal effort in future projects.

The final component is data loading, where the transformed dataset is saved into a new CSV file or exported to another local storage format. The goal is to ensure the processed data is stored in a clean and
accessible format, ready for further analysis or input into a machine learning model. This step completes the ETL pipeline and reinforces the importance of data workflow automation.

 The deliverable for this internship task is a fully functional Python script or Jupyter Notebook that automates the entire ETL process from raw data ingestion to loading the final output. The script or note
 book must be well-structured and include clear comments and documentation. It should reflect best practices in coding, such as modularity, reusability, and error handling. Interns are encouraged to include
 sample input and output files along with a brief README that explains the components of th#e pipeline and how to execute the code.

By completing this task, interns will gain practical experience in building data pipelines—a critical part of real-world data science workflows. This project will demonstrate the intern’s ability to 
preprocess, transform, and manage datasets efficiently, and to implement ETL solutions using standard Python libraries. The project also serves as a foundational experience for more advanced topics 
such as machine learning, MLOps, and big data processing.
